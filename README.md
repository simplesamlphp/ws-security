A PHP library for WS-Security related functionality.

## Before you use it

**DO NOT USE THIS LIBRARY UNLESS YOU ARE INTIMATELY FAMILIAR
WITH THE WS-SECURITY SPECIFICATION.**

If you are not familiar with the WS-Security specification and are simply looking
to connect your application using WS-Security, you should probably use
[SimpleSAMLphp](https://www.simplesamlphp.org) and, more specically, the adfs-module.

## Usage

* Install with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md),
run the following command in your project:

```bash
composer require simplesamlphp/ws-security:dev-master
```
