## Before you use it
**DO NOT USE THIS LIBRARY UNLESS YOU ARE INTIMATELY FAMILIAR WITH THE WS-TRUST SPECIFICATION.**

If you are not familiar with the WS-Trust specification and are simply looking to connect your application using WS-Trust,
you should probably use [SimpleSAMLphp](https://www.simplesamlphp.org), more specically, the adfs-module.

## Usage

* Install with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md), run the following command in your project:

```bash
composer require tvdijen/ws-trust:dev-master
```
